You can use Hummingbird to quickly add words to your list and check out their definitions and pronunciations later.

## Tech used: React, Material UI, Axios, CSS, Jest

For this application, I focused on creating a simple and intuitive UX with minimal distractions that looks good on all devices and screens. Users can save words for future reference and listen to their pronunciation.

## Optimizations

One of the optimizations I made was to add a state for user saved words and their definitions. This reduces the number of API calls and improves the user experience. Due to the nature of the project, I chose mobile first approach. In addition, if a word doesn't have a pronunciation, the play button won't show up.

## Lessons Learned:

Minimize the amount of UI elements to focus the user's attention on what really matters to your application.
